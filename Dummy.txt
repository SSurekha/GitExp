Are you a person who is ready to face the failures and is aware of the consequences if the business does not click.Let me walk you through an imaginary character called Mr.Sharma who has some similar thoughts of running a business after his retirerment.



This story is about a person called Mr. Arun Sharma, aged 59, holding a respectable position in a reputed organization.He is getting retired in next month.He is very active and energetic person.His wife Mrs. Asha Sharma a professor from a JR Grade College compliments husband in many way.They have two sons,Mr.Kapil and Mr.Sunil.Mr Kapil is 6 ft tall chap,well groomed,with a black french beard.He is a Bank manager by profession.His wife Mrs.Kapil is currently taking care of newly arrived twin kids*(girls). Mr Sunil is 5.8 ft tall, a normal looking chap.He is a doctor by profession.Mrs.Sunil is a gynecologist by profession and has 2 kids(daughter and son).Daughter in laws are highly educated* and from highly affluent family. Daughters Kanchan and Archana both are married and settled abroad.Kanchan is a famous classical singer by profession and husband also in the same field.They have 1 kid(girl).Archana is a house wife got married to a business magnet.They are happy with 2 kids(boys).Mr Sharma lives with his parents Mr and Mrs.Deepak Sharma, aged 85 and 75, who were farmers by profession.They joined their son to spend their last stages in life..

Mr Sharma had a dream to run his own business from his early teenage,unfortunately he couldnot fulfill his dream due to personal commitments at home and work.Days passed by and finally his time for retirement approached.



Mr.Sharma had planned to give a lunch party to his his team.It was a weekend and Mr.Sharma and his colleagues went out to a restaurant for a lunch.Mr.Sharma had to give hand off activities to a person the same day after 3 o clk.There were nearly 50 people who had to gather to the lunch party.It was Mr.Sharma and his immediate team started early.Rest has to pool up slowly and come in batches.By the time all gathered it was 2 o clk.The place where they had gone was heavily crowded and the entire team had to wait for a long time for their seats.Prior reservation was not done due to uncertainity of the number of people joining for lunch on that day.People had to wait long hours for their turn to take food as the items served were getting over very fast.Mr.Sharma on the other side was thinking of the hand off activities to the person he had asked to meet.

There was lot of laughters and merries happening all round the place they were sitting.None could hear what the other person was asking or saying.Birthday songs was played one side and people were singing birthday songs the other side.Some how by 3:30 PM all of the people from Mr.Sharma company reached office with heavy stomach and long faces.Some had meetings at 2:30 /3 o clk.Some had client calls.Mr.Sharma had rushed to see if the person whom he has asked had come to office.This farewell party made Mr.Sharma think in many directions what all may be required to set up a food restaurant.The day descended with lot of ideas in Sharma mind on how he would make his food restaurant a success.



It was early in the morning,Mrs.Sharma observed her husband murmuring.Suddenly she saw him woke up from the bed with a burst of excitement in his voice,he immediately realized that it was a dream,the dream that kept chasing him from many years.His wife knew a many things about her husband but todays action made her feel she had to discuss with him on starting up a business post retirement.That way she felt that he would be occupied and feel more happy about what he was going to do.



The couple sat in the balcony having coffee in the morning at 7 o Clk..Mr Sharma was quite for a very long time.His wife slowly expressed her interest to resign from her career and start a food restaurant as they had no more commitments and they would spend rest of their time running their own business.Mr.Sharma was excited to know this from his wife.They soon started talking a lot about how to go about it.



In the office, Mr.Sharma retirement farewell was planned by his team members and close friends.Meanwhile Mrs. Asha had invited home all her family members to honour Mr.Sharma on the occasion of his retirement. Mr.Sharma was already involved imagining him runnning a restaurant post retirement, and the challenges he might face at that age.



Finally after a week the day arrived,when Mr.Sharma had to bid farewell to his company,the last day of his career..All his colleagues bid him farewell with speeches, bouquet of flowers and applaudes.He was sent home with great honour.



Mr.Sharma reached home and discovered all his family had assembled to greet him a warm retirement.Mrs.Sharma had already discussed with husband to take the entire family out for a dinner the next day.All the family members sat together to discuss as to which restaurant would be good for a family get together.Each one started sharing their opinions.
